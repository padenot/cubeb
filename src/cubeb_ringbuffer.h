 * This data structure allow producing data from one thread, and consuming it on
 * another thread, safely and without explicit synchronization. If used on two
 * threads, this data structure uses atomics for thread safety. It is possible
 * to disable the use of atomics at compile time and only use this data
 * structure on one thread.
 *
 * The role for the producer and the consumer must be constant, i.e., the
 * producer should always be on one thread and the consumer should always be on
 * another thread.
 *
 * The public interface of this class uses frames.
 *
 * Some words about the inner workings of this class:
 * - Capacity is fixed. Only one allocation is performed, in the constructor.
 *   When reading and writing, the return value of the method allow checking if
 *   the ring buffer is empty or full.
 * - We always keep the read index at least one frame ahead of the write
 *   index, so we can distinguish between an empty and a full ring buffer: an
 *   empty ring buffer is when the write index is at the same position as the
 *   read index. A full buffer is when the write index is exactly one position
 *   before the read index.
 * - We synchronize updates to the read index after having read the data, and
 *   the write index after having written the data. This means that the each
 *   thread can only touch a portion of the buffer that is not touched by the
 *   other thread.
 * - Callers are expected to provide buffers. When writing to the queue,
 *   frames are copied into the internal storage from the buffer passed in.
 *   When reading from the queue, the user is expected to provide a buffer.
 *   Because this is a ring buffer, data might not be contiguous in memory,
 *   providing an external buffer to copy into is an easy way to have linear
 *   data for further processing.
