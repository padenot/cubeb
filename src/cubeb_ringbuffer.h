 * This data structure allow producing data from one thread, and consuming it on
 * another thread, safely and without explicit synchronization. If used on two
 * threads, this data structure uses atomics for thread safety. It is possible
 * to disable the use of atomics at compile time and only use this data
 * structure on one thread.
 *
 * The role for the producer and the consumer must be constant, i.e., the same
 * thread should always be the producer and another thread should always be the
 * consumer.
 *
 * The public interface of this class uses frames.
 *
 * Some words about the inner workings of this class:
 * - Capacity is fixed. Only one allocation is performed, in the constructor.
 *   When reading and writing, the return value of the method allow checking is
 *   the ring buffer is empty or full.
 * - We always keep the read index at least one element ahead of the write
 *   index, so we can distinguish between an empty and a full ring buffer: an
 *   empty ring buffer is when the write index is at the same position as the
 *   write index. A full buffer is when the write index is exactly one position
 *   before the read index.
 * - We synchronize updates to the read index after having read the data, and
 *   the write index after having written the data. This means that the each
 *   thread can only touch a portion of the buffer that is not touched by the
 *   other thread.
 * - Caller is expected to provide an output buffer. When writing to the queue,
 *   elements are copied. When reading from the queue, the user is expected to
 *   provide a buffer. Because this is a ring buffer, data might not be
 *   contiguous in memory, providing an external buffer to copy into is an easy
 *   way to have linear data for further processing.
